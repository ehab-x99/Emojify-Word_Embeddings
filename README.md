# Emojify

Emojify is a Python script that converts text into emojis. Given a sentence or phrase as input, the script replaces each word with the corresponding emoji, if one exists. The script includes a dictionary of common words and their corresponding emojis, but users can also add their own custom mappings.

# Featuress:

The script maps the sentiment of the text to a set of predefined emojis as follows:

Positive sentiment: 😁😊😃😄😆😍😘😚😜😝
Neutral sentiment: 😐😶😏😒😔😕
Negative sentiment: 😞😟😠😡😢😣😤😥😦😧

# Custom Emoji Mappings

To add custom emoji mappings, you can create a file called custom_mappings.txt in the same directory as the script. The file should contain one mapping per line, in the format word:emoji, where word is the word to be replaced and emoji is the corresponding emoji.
